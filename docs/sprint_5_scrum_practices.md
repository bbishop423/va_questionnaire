* ### SCRUM PRACTICES FOR SPRINT 5

	Our team has used various aspects of the Scrum process for planning the development of the VA's clinician questionnaire system.  We have 
	continued to meet to plan and discuss our project for approximately 90 minutes after each class period.  Along with our after class meetings we have collaborated outside of class as well.  We collaborated on-line through email and base camp.
	
	We continued to use the Scrum practice of using user stories.  We took our chosen user stories and created plans to implement them.  We used our user story plans to implement classes and methods to add functionality to the system.  The other user stories were discussed and we decided we would complete them during a later sprint.
	
	We created different artifacts during this sprint.  One artifact we created was the additional functionality to the system.  Methods were added to allow insertion and deletion of users in the database.  The view was updated and implemented as well as functionality to perform additional operations on the data in the database. We updated the README based upon the requests we received from the product owner to include the progress of the different user stories.   The user stories were updated with conversation and acceptance criteria added to each one.  Sequence diagrams were created for certain user stories.
