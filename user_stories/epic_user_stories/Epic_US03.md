User Story
---
As a user, I want to be able to access parts of the application that are applicable to me and I want others to be denied access to parts that are not pertinent to them, so that the 
application will be secure. 

Conversation
----
	* How many separate passcodes should we have? (One per clinician, one per clinic, etc.)
	* What areas should we allow each separate category of user to access?
	* There should be a specific passcode entered/option so that the patient taking the survey cannot access other screens.
	* Who should be able to create profiles, change passcodes, etc.?

Acceptance Criteria
----
	* Only certain parts of the application should be displayed, depending on the passcode entered. 
	* There is a way to change/update passcodes if needed.
	* The application should allow the user to enter the passcode at startup so that it knows what to present to the user.
