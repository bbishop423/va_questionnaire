### Mission Statement
The Veterans Affairs Hospital in Johnson City, TN is currently using 
a paper based system to collect data regarding patient testing results.
This method is outdated, inefficient, insecure, and difficult to 
administrate. The VA Hospital needs to be able to record patient test 
results in a manner which makes it easy to not only record the data, 
but also to retrieve it and compile it in ways that convey meaning to 
the researchers utilizing the data. Using a paper based method can be 
error prone, due to the multiple times that data must be recorded and 
calculated by hand. Paper based methods are inefficient because 
the researchers must take time to search through containers of physical
paper documents. Researchers must take the time to read each document to 
determine if the data recorded on it is relevant to their current 
research activity. The system also needs to be able to be searched quickly
and efficiently, compiling documents containing only accurate data 
relevant to the current research project.
### Vision Statement
The Patient Profile Management System (PPMS) will provide its users 
with a system that will be easy to implement and use. It will
effectively minimize overhead costs associated with training and
system integration, thus increase the amount of time clinicians
have to focus on other obligations. The PPMS will provide its
users with quick and secure access to patient data in order to 
perform analytics.
### Business Value
The PPMS will allow the VA to collect data on their patients who are
undergoing treatment for hearing loss. The PPMS will allow the VA to
store the data in a secure manner so that compliance with HIPA requirements
will be achieved. The VA will be able to store the data in an electronic
format.  This will provide a cost savings to the organization by reducing
paper costs, as well as labor costs involved with recording, retreiving, and
compiling any data results. The VA will also be able to meet a higher level
of data integrity with the PPMS because the data will be recorded in a single
electronic format. This will reduce the potential for human error as less of
this business process will need to be performed by hand.
### Stakeholders
* System Administrator - The system administrator is responsible for
  configuring and maintaining the PPMS. This primarily consists of
  maintaining users and roles.
* Clinicians - The clinicians are the employees such as nurses and
  doctors that provide exams. Their primary interaction with the PPMS
  is unlocking the system to allow patients to answer the
  questionnaires, or entering the answers to the questions into the
  system from a patients hard copy.
* Patients - Patients are the customers at each clinic that have came
  to get exams. They will either answer the questionnaires in the PPMS
  during their visit or answer the questions then give them to a
  clinician to be entered into the system.
* Researchers - The researchers work for the research foundation. They
  will take the results from the PPMS and compare them to other results
  from around the country to draw conclusions.
* Management - The management are the people in the front office
  funding the project. They  are responsible for seeing that the system
  is properly implemented, and that the clinicians are properly trained
  to use the system correctly.
### Milestones
  1. Project Initialization: Beginning 27 January, 2015
    * Setup Version Control System (GIT and BitBucket)
    * Project management setup (Basecamp)
    * Development Environment setup (Visual Studio 2013 - C# and .NET 4.5)
    * Micro-charter completed
    * Stakeholders identified
    * Epic user-stories developed
  2. Next Sprint (Tentative): Beginning 10 February, 2015
    * Break epic user-stories down into smaller, more managable user-stories
    * Pick a number of user-stories to begin implementing
    * Begin implementation/development
  3. Project Final Delivery (Projected): April 30, 2015
    * Deliver finished version to client
