* ### SCRUM PRACTICES FOR SPRINT 1

	Our team has used various aspects of the Scrum process early in planning process for our system. We have been very collaborative working on, 
	and planning for our project. We have met together every class period for at least 90 minutes after lecture as finished, and usually longer. 
	We have used these meetings to set our prioritize and try to plan exactly what we would like to get accomplished during this sprint.

	One Scrum practice we have used this sprint is the breaking up of the team into specific roles.  The team discussed our specific skill sets 
	and how each of us could be used with the greatest efficiency within the project. Every team member agreed upon the needed roles for this project
	and then accepted their role based upon their particular strength within the team.
	
	Another Scrum practice we utilized are the user stories. Much of our early planning has been to try to take the project specifications and 
	turn them into epic user stories. Though these stories are very large in scope, we will use future sprints to break these epic user 
	stories down into more useable user stories. Time will need to be spent with the product owner to clarify further details about the client's
	needs. During our post lecture meetings we discussed the PRD and created 5 epic user stories from it.
	
	We have created artifacts in the form of a microcharter and 5 epic user stories. The microcharter defines our team and also provides contact 
	information for each member within the team. Each team member's strengths are listed in the microcharter as well as their role within the team
	based on those particular strengths. Another artifact that has been created are the 5 epic user stories. These user stories encompass the 
	PRD on a very high level. They simulate the user's needs in the form of 5 main points that need to be addressed when designing the system.
