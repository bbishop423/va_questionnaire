* ### SCRUM PRACTICES FOR SPRINT 3

	Our team has used various aspects of the Scrum process for planning the development of the VA's clinician questionnaire system.  We have 
	continued to meet to plan and discuss our project for approximately 90 minutes after each class period.  During this sprint we were unable
	to meet during our regular time after class because of inclement weather.  We instead collaborated on-line through email and base camp.
	
	We continued to use the Scrum practice of using user stories.  We took our chosen user stories and created plans to implement them.  We used our user story plans to implement classes and methods to add functionality to the system.  The other user stories were discussed and we decided we would complete them during a later sprint.
	
	We created different artifacts during this sprint.  One artifact we created was the additional functionality to the system.  The data was modelled and tables in the database were created.  The view was updated and implemented as well as functionality to perform operations on the data in the database. We updated the README based upon the requests we received from the product owner to include the progress of the different user stories.   The user stories were updated with conversation and acceptance criteria added to each one.
	A use case for our currently developed user story was created.
