* ### SCRUM PRACTICES FOR SPRINT 2

	Our team has used various aspects of the Scrum process for planning the development of the VA's clinician questionnaire system.  We have 
	continued to meet to plan and discuss our project for approximately 90 minutes after each class period.  During this sprint we were unable
	to meet during our regular time after class because of inclement weather.  We decided the best way to handle this situation would be for 
	all the team members to download TeamViewer and for us to meet on-line.  Using that software our team was able to collaborate and continue
	to discuss our project despite not being able to meet in person.

	One Scrum practce we have used this sprint is the breaking up the user stories into specific tasks.  Each team member was then delegated a
	particular task to accomplish in order to complete the user story.  The tasks were delegated to allow each task to be completed by the team
	member who has shown the highest level of expertise in that area.  The entire team agreed upon the tasks to be completed and which member
	would be the best one suited to complete that task.
	
	We continued to use the Scrum practice of using user stories.  We took our 5 epic user stories and chose one to break down into smaller 
	tasks.  We then used those tasks to decide which members would do what work during this sprint.  The other user stories were discussed and
	we decided we would complete them during a later sprint.
	
	We created different artifacts during this sprint.  One artifact was the revised microcharter.  We made revisions to our microcharter
	based upon the feedback we received from our product owner.  Another artifact that was created was the completed user story regarding 
	the login aspect of the proposed system.  We updated the README based upon the requests we received from the product owner to include
	the progress of the different user stories.   The user stories were updated with conversation and acceptance criteria added to each one.
	A use case for our currently developed user story was created.
