US 1 - Simple User Interface and Quick Login
=======

User Story
---
As a clinician/administrator, I want a simple user interface and quick login, so that I can access
the system quickly and easily while on the go.


Conversation
----
	* What login credentials should a user have (username/password, PIN number)?
	* What should the login UI look like?
	* Should the login screen be a part of the main window or a separate pop-up window?

Acceptance Criteria
----
	* User can enter credentials and successfully log in to the system.
	* On log in, it is determined whether user is a clinician or administrator based on credentials.
	* If login is UNSUCCESSFUL, user is returned to log in screen.
