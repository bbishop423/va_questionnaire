US 2 - Login Credentials Stored in Database
=======

User Story
---
As a clinician/administrator, I want my user credentials to be stored in a database, so that I can use them
to login to the system at any time.


Conversation
----
	* What information should be stored in the database along with credentials (if any)?
	* Should credentials be combined with Users table?

Acceptance Criteria
----
	* Upon entering credentials, the database is able to successfully find the credentials if they are valid.
	* If credentials are found, the corresponding User is also found.
